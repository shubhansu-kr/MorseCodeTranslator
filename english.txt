MongoDB Atlas provides an easy way to host and manage your data 
in the cloud. This tutorial guides you through creating an Atlas cluster, 
connecting to it, and loading sample data.

You can get started with Atlas through the Atlas CLI  
or the Atlas User Interface. Select a tab based on how you would 
like to get started:

To create and authenticate with your Atlas account, create one free 
database, load sample data, add your IP address to your project IP 
access list, create a MongoDB user, and view your connection string 
using the Atlas CLI, run the following command:

atlas setup [options]

o learn more about the command syntax and parameters, see the Atlas CLI documentation for 
atlas setup.

You can also run atlas setup if you have an Atlas account and an organization/project, 
but you haven't set up a cluster.
