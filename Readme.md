Introduction
Morse code is a method of transmitting string information into a series of dots[.] and dashes[-] encrypting a 
message between two entities and so making communication possible between two parties. And we are going 
to have the fun task of doing just that.
Abstract 
Morse code is: 
• an alphabet or code in which letters are represented by combinations of long and short light or sound 
signals. 
• a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two 
different signal durations, called dots and dashes, or dots and dahs
• named after Samuel Morse, one of the inventors of the telegraph 
The dot duration is the basic unit of time measurement in Morse code transmission. The duration of a dah is 
three times the duration of a dot. Each dot or dah within an encoded character is followed by a period of 
signal absence, called a space, equal to the dot duration. The letters of a word are separated by a space of 
duration equal to three dots, and words are separated by a space equal to seven dots.
